        <h3 class="underline font-bold text-md pb-1">About Me</h3>
        <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
            Hello!  I‚Äôm Sahil Suresh, an MD-PhD student at Tufts University School of Medicine.  

            I am extremely passionate about ways in which we can broadly leverage advancements in technology to better inform medicine.  This involves the study of recurrent neural networks, mathematical modeling, machine learning and their roles in decoding the complex neural dynamics associated with cognitive dysfunction and aberrant behavioral patterns associated with psychiatric disease states.
        </p>
        <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
            During my PhD education, I hope to explore novel deep learning frameworks that can parse meaningful patterns from fMRI data to serve as early biomarkers for often underdiagnosed psychiatric conditions. 
        </p>
        <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
            During my MD education, I am interested in AI-driven solutions to increasing accessibility to medical education.
        </p>
        <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
            In terms of side-projects, I'm extremely interested MedEd, game design and poetry; message if you're looking to collaborate!

                Yet another successful attempt at Apple's international coding
                competition. By making use of SwiftUI once more, I created a short app
                experience that explores recursive art patterns and abstract art. With
                the help of generative art, I was able to create a unique experience
                that most people would have rarely come across.

                My second try at Apple's international coding competition was finally a
                successful one. Making use of my prowess with web development, I decided
                to create a Swift Playground project that taught users how to make use
                of HTML and CSS to create a simple website.

                Making use of Apple's SwiftUI framework as well as the nifty WKWebView
                API, I managed to create a working editor that would allow users to
                meddle with HTML and CSS. I proceeded to create a playground book
                project around that idea and came up with a tutorial sequence for the
                user to follow.
